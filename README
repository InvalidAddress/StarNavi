This project is for a Senior Research class at Shippensburg University. As I have no practical knowledge of how the Linux desktop works, I can't guarantee the finished product's compatibility with existing desktop managers. Additionally, this project does not intend to produce a full desktop manager, but merely a desktop interface; management of windows, generation of panels, navigation of the filesystem, etc. are likely to be managed by the user's default applications. This is an independent work done by an amateur, and I take no responsibility if it screws up your system.
